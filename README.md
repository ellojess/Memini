### Organize Tasks from the Project based on Status
After clicking on a project from the Home page, users will be able to see the tasks that are in progress and the tasks that have been completed based on the segment controller tab they are viewing. New tasks can be added by clicking the ```Add Task``` button on the To Do List page and then the ```Save``` button on the Add New Task page.
